Cracking the Caesar cipher

When encrypted text is entered, it display the original, without asking what is the offset.

How it works:
- It is known that the most common letters in the English language are e, t, h
- Finds the most common symbol in the encrypted text
- Calculates how much is the offset from it to e, t, h
- The three decrypted versions are displayed of the original text
- If the user is not satisfied with the result, the remaining 22 versions of the text are shown
